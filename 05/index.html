          The Vietnam War got off to a slow start in the late 1950s —as the US slowly increased military presence in the South-East Asian Country— and came to a disastrous end in 1973 —with both Americans and South Vietnamese officers 
          scrambling to make it out on any helicopter or boat transport they could find, as Northern Vietnamese forces closed in on Saigon. In the 10 plus years that the war raged in the country, countless lives were lost on both sides. 
          The effects of the war were felt all over. The Vietnamese people found themselves torn between two sides, sympathizing with either could prove fatal if caught by the wrong people. The American servicemen, most of them young men 
          picked up by the draft, found themselves fighting an enemy they could not see in a country with a culture they had difficulty understanding. Politically, the war was fueled propaganda and anti-American sentiment pushed by the 
          Communist Soviet Bloc and China. Back in the US, the war played a profound effect in stimulating an entirely new era in the arts. Protests movements against the war merged with new styles in rock and roll, and concepts in visual 
          arts — to this day influences of the art that emerged during the Vietnam War can be found in the movies, music and paintings around us.
